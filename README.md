# python-or-not-python

This repository is for me a simple way to share with everyone some scripts and tools I made for me or at work. 

... and yes, why python-or-not-python ? 
I created a Facebook group named "Python or not Python" used for helping people and sharing a lot of things mostly related to Python (and other languages too).
It's a place where everyone on the group can share some tips and help each other. So, this repository is a solution to show and share scripts easily.

Python or not Python is like a snowclone of the famous quote "To be or not to be" and it also refers to the operator "or not". It's so fun... ! ;)
